# DFS-visualization
This visualization demonstrates Depth-First Search (DFS) on a graph using Pygame. Nodes are represented as circles, and edges are displayed with dynamic color changes to indicate traversal status. 
As the DFS algorithm progresses from a starting node, edges are highlighted in green, purple, or brown based on whether they are newly discovered,
back edges, or cross edges. Node visit and finish times are shown, and the traversal path is animated to enhance understanding of the algorithmâ€™s execution.
